                    <a id="what" class="anchor" href="#what"></a>What is a Standard?
                </h2>

                <p>A standard is a level of quality or attainment, or an idea or thing used as a measure, norm, or model in comparative evaluations. It can also mean that something is used or accepted as normal or average. In this case, it means both of those things.</p>

                <h2>
                    <a id="why" class="anchor" href="#why"></a>Why is a spec needed?
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Existing Standards can vary widely depending on what they are being applied to. The same standards don't apply on a small personal blog that apply on a late-night news broadcast. The standards that apply to a five-star restaurant do not apply to a McDonald's.                </p>
                <p>
                    In the absence of a spec, early standard-makers consulted their best judgement to decide on proper standards. But we think there are tons of problems with this whole situation and we're going to fix it because only we can.
                <p>
                    Because there is no unambiguous spec, standards have diverged considerably. As a result, people are often surprised to find that a standard that condemns one action or behavior in one situation (say, software piracy and resale) praises the same action or behavior in another (say, taking someone else's work and slapping a new name on it to make it your own and then distributing it without their permission). To make matters worse, because people are sometimes stupid, the divergence often isn't discovered right away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's no standard test suite for standards; there's common sense and personal judgement, and occasionally a societal norm, but these can vary wildly when applied to different situations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We propose a <strong>standard, unambiguous syntax specification for Standards</strong>, along with a <strong>suite of comprehensive tests</strong> to validate Standards against this specification. We believe this is necessary, even essential, for the future of Standards.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That's what we call <strong>Standard Standard</strong>.  <img src="images/standard-mark.png" height="22" alt="Standard Standard" style="vertical-align:top" />

                <p>A person who makes jokes on the Internet sometimes. </p>

                    <a id="how" class="anchor" href="#how"></a>How can I help?
                </h2>

                <p>Read the <a href="spec.html/">spec</a>, share this website on social networks, and just generally laugh at Standard Markdown.</p>

                <p>Perhaps the best way to provide feedback is to <strong>implement your own Standard Standard</strong>, as one of our major goals is to make standards easier to parse, and to eliminate the many old inconsistencies and ambiguities that made creating a standard so difficult. Did we succeed?</p>

                <h2>
                    <a id="where" class="anchor" href="#where"></a>Where can I find it?
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Right here. This is it. You found it. Gold frickin' star.                </p>

                <h2>
                    <a id="when" class="anchor" href="#when"></a>When is the spec final?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The current version of the Standard Standard spec is complete (two minutes in the making!), but provisional pending public feedback, testing, and evaluation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With your help, we plan to announce a finalized 1.0 spec and test suite in the next few months, along with implementations in many different languages.
